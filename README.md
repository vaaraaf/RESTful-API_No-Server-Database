This is a program for API-based comminiuation of two sides which are called Server and Client.</br>
The Server hosts the data on **RAM** and has different API functionalities:</br></br>
1- **GET**:Used to get the data whether for all records or for a specific record</br>
2- **POST**:   Used to send new record to the end-point and the server saves the new record.</br>
3- **PUT**:    Used to modify any of the existing records.</br>
4- **DELETE**: Used to delete specific record from data.</br>

**ATTENTION:**</br>
Everytime you restart the server, the data will be lost becasue this code is RAM-based.</br>
